### Goal Achieved

When I was in junior high, I saw this movie called 'AntiTrust'. A story about a young computer programmer who gets the dream job at a large tech company, but then learns there are sinster things happening behind closed doors. This movie, whatever your opinion of it, has a very special place in my heart because it showed me something I had never seen before: jobs in the tech world.

I still remember watching the scene where Milo goes into his office for the first time and I said to myself "Wow, that is amazing. I want to work in a place like that one day."

I never really told anyone about it and as I moved on into high school, my life became more about my band and...well...girls. Being a father now to a lovely little girl, I cringe at my young prepubesent self. Tangent.

Over the years, I found that I was slowly merging into the life of a graphic designer and eventually landed a job at a local print shop. From there, I bounced around learning what I could from different tech companies and then found myself at Art Institute of San Bernardino - Inland Empire. After being in the Web Design and Interactive Media program for 4 years, I started reaching out to some companies and getting interviews.

It was a little tough to get started but I was feeling good about it. Then, while still finishing up school, I got an email from one of my potential employeers, Jeff Berg - CEO of Planning Center. I never was emailed by a CEO before and my nerves were pretty much on fire. First, I really didn't think I was qualified for the job because in the description there was mention of Git, Ruby, and other front end techologies that I really wasn't too familiar with.

He sent me a code challenge and, I flaked. I laugh when I think about it now, but I was so scared and I didn't think I even had a shot. So I just basically passed on it. Next day, I get another email from Jeff, asking if I recieved the email and they were interested. So, instead of being honest(which I regret) I lied.

"Oh, I didn't get the challenge. Could you send it again? There is something up with my email."

That type of thing.

He was gracious enough to send it again and give me 24hrs to complete it. In hindsight, it was a super easy front end excercise to update a couple of buttons. But at the time, I was super nervous and no one was even watching me. I stayed up until 4am working on it. I still remember my wife (girl friend at the time) sitting there watching me go over every pixel.

Finally, I hit the send button. Next morning, I got an email asking me to come down for an interview. It was a 2.5 hour drive down to North County San Diego from where I was in the high desert, so I was ready to leave early that Friday morning.

I had a vague idea of what to expect based on the images on the job profile but it wasn't compared to walking into that building the first time. I arrived around 9am to the offices in Carlsbad, went up to the door and knocked.

A tall guy in shorts and a t-shirt answered and said "Hey, I'm Jeff." I had never really met the CEO of a tech company but I didn't really expect someone like Jeff. He was really down to earth, took me on a tour of the building, then I chilled in the waiting room waiting for our lead designer, Shane Armitage, to arrive from Utah.

I remember thinking "Geez, they flew in a guy from Utah to meet me? I better do good in this interview."

Shane finally came in after a few minutes waiting there. He was a really cool guy, friendly and very relaxed. We mostly talked about personal stuff and my background. It was the chillest interview I had ever done. I really had no clue whether or not I got the job but I left feeling good - and the primary reason was because I was just totally and completely honest. Probably a little too honest with certain things but I still felt really good.

I got a call from Jeff two days later with a job offer and I was off to the races.

Moving away from home for the first time, my first big job, living on my own, it was lot to take in. I started that week with my first day on a Friday Oct 11th 2011. It was the companies open house for the new building. It was just like the movie, AntiTrust. Modern, clean, with a really cool design.

Onboarding was, kind of none existant. I sat in a session with about a two dozen of local customers getting an overview of our app. I tried to pay attention closely but it was like drinking from a fire hose.

But all of my co-workers were really awesome people. I loved talking with them and getting to know them and their families and learning about the history of the company. It was a great time and I was excited to work on stuff for this awesome company. Now nine years later, I still look back on that day as one of the best days in my professional life. I thank God for the opportunity and I can't wait until the next one.
