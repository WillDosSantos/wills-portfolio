### Goal Achieved

When I was in junior high, I saw this movie called 'AntiTrust'. A story about a young computer programmer who gets the dream job at a large tech company, but then learns there are sinster things happening behind closed doors. This movie, whatever your opinion of it, has a very special place in my heart because it showed me something I had never seen before: jobs in the tech world.

I still remember watching the scene where Milo goes into his office for the first time and I said to myself "Wow, that is amazing. I want to work in a place like that one day."

I never really told anyone about it and as I moved on into high school, my life became more about my band and...well...girls. Being a father now to a lovely little girl, I cringe at my young prepubesent self. Tangent.

Over the years, I found that I was slowly merging into the life of a graphic designer and eventually landed a job at a local print shop. From there, I bounced around learning what I could from different tech companies and then found myself at Art Institute of San Bernardino - Inland Empire. After being in the Web Design and Interactive Media program for 4 years, I started reaching out to some companies and getting interviews.

It was a little tough to get started but I was feeling good about it. Then, while still finishing up school, I got an email from one of my potential employeers, Jeff Berg - CEO of Planning Center. I never was emailed by a CEO before and my nerves were pretty much on fire. First, I really didn't think I was qualified for the job because in the description there was mention of Git, Ruby, and other front end techologies that I really wasn't too familiar with.

He sent me a code challenge and, I flaked. I laugh when I think about it now, but I was so scared and I didn't think I even had a shot. So I just basically passed on it. Next day, I get another email from Jeff, asking if I recieved the email and they were interested. So, instead of being honest(which I regret) I lied.

"Oh, I didn't get the challenge. Could you send it again? There is something up with my email."

That type of thing.

He was gracious enough to send it again and give me 24hrs to complete it. In hindsight, it was a super easy front end excercise to update a couple of buttons. But at the time, I was super nervous and no one was even watching me. I stayed up until 4am working on it. I still remember my wife (girl friend at the time) sitting there watching me go over every pixel.

Finally, I hit the send button.
