###Pico's Arcade

One day during our lunch break, I turned to a friend of mine and said, “It would be really cool to have an arcade cabinet here.” Now, I will admit, this was a selfish request, at least a little bit. And for the most part, I didn’t think anything would come out of it.
But then I started to think about it. Our boss, Jeff Berg, cares about every single one of his employees and he shows it to us every day. Whether just by listening to us, or doing really cool things around the office like nerf wars, scooters, billiards, darts, the list goes on.
I thought, “Maybe he’d go for it.”

Sure enough, I drew out the idea for it, and he was on board. At first, we just thought we’d design something basic, and that we would pay for it to be manufactured. In hindsight, we probably should have done that. But, if we went that route, the cabinet wouldn’t hold as much significance to the company.

So the building process had begun. Along with me, we had Erik Bye, Tanner Mares, Kevin Thompson, and Peter Fokos. We had two weeks to do because at Planning Center, every quarter we get two free weeks to do whatever we want so long it’s for the company. Since building this cabinet the policy has changed a little bit :) but Jeff loves it either way.

I’m also proud to say that we were able to install quite a few games on it such as Puzzle Bobble, PacMan, TMNT, Tower Fall, and loads more.
Designing the cabinet was a little tough, but Erik Bye led a great team.

**My main focus** was on the graphics and user interface. I really wanted it to look cool. Like something that time-warped from the 80s. I made sure to put our mascot “Pico” throughout it, and ultimately, I feel like it was successful.

I’m super proud whenever we have visitors to the office and they right away want to go over to the cabinet and play with it. It’s great for all ages, and everyone gets a kick out of it.

Thanks goes to Jeff Berg for allowing us the opportunity to build something great for an already great company.
