# The Contest

This year, Planning Center decided to do something special for it's 15 year anniversary. It was decided that instead of our lead designer or myself creating the year logo, which was the common approach, there would be a contest internally in the company. Everyone would get to vote on the logo they thought was the best, and although I didn't win I was was happy to be apart of it, and even happier for my buddy Jesse Cohen (our lead cinematogapher and editor).

But since we can show off our work, I thought I wouldwould include them here. The instructions for the contest were a bit fuzzy at first. I was under the impression that we could do as many logos as we wanted so I did 15 :) For the 15 years. Sadly, we could only submit two.

But here they all are.
