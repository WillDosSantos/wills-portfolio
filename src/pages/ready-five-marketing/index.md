# Welcome to GatsbyJS

If you are hearing about GatsbyJS for the first time on my blog, first I am honored I get to share this with you. And second, perpare to have your mind blown.

### Version 1

### Visual Design System

For the design system, I decided to work directly with our lead developer and co-founder Tanner Mares. The game plan was that I would define the styles in our Figma doc, and notify him once each section/category of the system was complete. Once he was notified, he would implement the styles. We hammered it out in about 2 weeks - if that. Love working with that guy!

Because I complete control of the visual direction and both James and Tanner trusted me to get the job done, I was was able to streamline the process a lot faster. There are a lot of things I would probably change, but in order to achieve a MVP, I felt it was necessary to move as fast as possible.

#### Light Mode

#### Dark Mode

Working on the dark mode, we decided to take an easier approach with only lessing the HSL by 20% for for the majority of the colors on the buttons and inputs. Thankfully, because the app is still fairly new, we have some room to experiment and gauge user feedback. One thing that is crucial and should have been from the beginning is accessibility, which we will be looking to refine further hopefully in the near future.
