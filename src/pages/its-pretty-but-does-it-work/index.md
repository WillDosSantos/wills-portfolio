###It's pretty, but does it work?

What's the old saying? Function with form or form with function?

So you just wrapped up your latest Figma comps, pasted the link into your Slack channel, and now ready for the feedback. You're confident that this itiration is the one. It has to be! You did everything your manager requested of you, you listened and gathered customer feedback, looked a past examples, what UI was currently trending; you've done it all.

Notification goes off, and you are staring and that daunting compliment sandwich.

"It looks great! I love it! One small change..."

Oh man, delicious. I'm joking of course. Change is inevitable when it comes to design. And when you are designing for people of wonderous variety you have to take into account the different perspectives of experience in order to make the design have some function.

### Accessibilty

This is something that I have igrnored in the past, and I regret it. Accessibility is not something that I have found very exciting to work on and I do feel icky saying that but it's the truth. I have always put it off to the last minute and didn't really think too much about it until I met a color blind friend of mine at Jiu Jitsu years ago.

He said to me "Hey, can you tell me which guys are wearing black belts and which are wearing blue? I can't tell the difference."

I was kind of shocked because of my own ignorance to something like that. I mean, this friend of mine, through no fault of his own, could have been trying to spare a little harder with a black belt or what he thought was a black belt, and actually was sparing a blue belt that was at his level. To people outside of the world of BJJ, it probably doesn't seem like a big deal. But trust me, there are certain people you want to spare hard with and certain ones you don't. Context and surrounding is important in any kind of martial art, and if you are unaware of the boundaries or limits you could hurt yourself or someone else.

But let's get back to design.
