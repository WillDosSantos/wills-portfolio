### Summary
Our GGP9000 approach is in direct alignment with Avax9000, the effort to streamline and simplify the launching of a custom layer 1 blockchain. This is a crucial for increased decentralization and rapid blockchain deployment. The design here is the first pass at marketing the idea to those inside and outside of the community.

The hero is meant to convey the idea of a growing community with some subtle branding elements from the Avalanche (mountains). Blocks are sprinkled throughout the visuals here.
