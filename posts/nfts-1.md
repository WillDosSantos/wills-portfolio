When first introduced to NFTs, I was already too late. The market had shifted and this was back in 2020. People were buying images of pixelated rocks and I thought, "Well, I could do better than that." How naive I was. But still, Retro Rider is probably one of my favorite art pieces. Need to get that printed and hung up on my wall.
