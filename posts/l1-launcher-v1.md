### Wireframes

We first had this idea when we created GoGoCode, a way to launch your own L1 blockchain with the click of a button. The initial design was wrapped around the idea of an educational aspect that would pertain to the retail market while more experienced and insitutional investors wouldn't require that much hand holding.

### Sample UI

The initial approach to the design was something very asthetically pleasing to the eye.
