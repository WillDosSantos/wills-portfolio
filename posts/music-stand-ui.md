### Planning Center Music Stand: Designed to Let Musicians Shine

Planning Center Music Stand, part of the Planning Center suite, is a polished digital music-reader app and platform that empowers worship musicians to practice, perform, and collaborate with clarity and confidence. Leveraging both a slick web interface and native mobile apps, it reimagines the music stand for today's digital-first musicians.

#### Core Features & Experience

- Seamless Annotation Tools: Musicians can highlight, draw, or type notes directly on PDFs—with annotations saved per user and sharable or mergeable across different versions or collaborators.

- Intuitive Navigation: Advance pages via swiping, scrolling, tapping the edge, or stepping on a USB/Bluetooth foot pedal. Support includes both horizontal swipes and configurable vertical scroll or half-page shifts.

- Media & Tempo Tools: Integrated audio playback (with looping) and a metronome—complete with visual flash cues—help musicians rehearse and perform with precision.

- Device Sync & External Display: A “Sessions” feature allows one device to control page turns across all linked devices on stage. Plus, external display support—via HDMI, VGA, AirPlay, or Bluetooth mirroring—ensures the whole team stays in sync.

- Offline Access & Persistent Settings: Users can access their last 10 service plans even when offline. Custom zoom levels, color modes (including default dark mode), and settings persist per user for quick setup.

- Flexible Chart Editing: The mobile apps support editing or creating chord charts directly—letting musicians customize lyrics or chords and transpose them dynamically.
