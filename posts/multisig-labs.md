### Capturing lighting in a bottle

I've been exploring some new approaches to brand design. Usually, I fixate on the logo and color scheme a first but this time I decided to work backwards a bit and start with the weblayout. There are so many sources of inspiration out there and one that I often look at and wish that I could use is from Mike at Creative Mints. His work is all over dribbble if you are interested. I highly recommend checking it out.

Although I have seen a ton of his work as far as static design goes, I have never seen it implemented so I would love to check that out at some point. Either way, I decided to borrow some approaches from him and others in this exploration of creating a brand for Multisig Labs, Inc.
