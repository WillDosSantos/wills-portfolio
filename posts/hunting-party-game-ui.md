### Summary
Early this year I got the chance to work with the OOPA NFT team. Our goal was build a Subnet and use our tech here a GoGoPool to host it for the Party Mansion team. I was given the task of creating a page design that would match the 8-bit style that the team had already crafted as a part of their established brand. This was definitely a rush job, and I had a full plate of GoGoPool tasks and management to work on. But it was great to be able to connect with these folks and produce what ended up being a cool game.

#### Wireframing

There wasn't a whole lot of direction here other than a couple of references to what data would be displayed for the players. UX, as always, had to be considered and we went through quick iterations on the wireframes and flowcharts.
