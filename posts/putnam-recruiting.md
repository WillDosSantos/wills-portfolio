### Overview

Putnam Recruiting, led by Wes Putnam, specializes in helping companies identify and secure top talent through a relationship-driven approach. To expand business development efforts, Wes needed a set of client-facing flyers that clearly articulated the firm’s methodology, values, and differentiators. These flyers were designed to function as BD tools, giving prospective clients a quick but compelling understanding of Putnam Recruiting’s process.

#### Challenge

Recruiting is a highly competitive field, and many firms sound the same on paper. The challenge was to design materials that:

- Clearly communicate how Putnam Recruiting is different.

- Visually reflect professionalism and trustworthiness.

- Present information in a way that is quick to digest while leaving a strong impression.

- Serve both as standalone leave-behinds and as conversation-supporting tools for business development meetings.

#### Design Approach

1. Discovery & Collaboration

I worked directly with Wes to understand his unique recruiting philosophy and the specific client concerns he wanted to address. We identified the core value props — such as relationship focus, personalized attention, and proven results — and mapped these into messaging pillars for the flyers.

2. Content Structuring

To avoid overwhelming potential clients, I created a hierarchical content layout:

- Headline/Hook → captures attention.

- Process & Approach → step-by-step explanation of how Putnam Recruiting works.

- Key Differentiators → why this approach leads to better hires.

- Call to Action → clear next step for potential clients.

3. Visual Design

The visual direction emphasized:

- Clean, professional typography for trust and clarity.

- Structured layouts with white space to improve readability.

- Strategic use of color and icons to highlight key steps in the recruiting process.

4. Iteration & Refinement

Through collaborative feedback sessions with Wes, we refined both copy and design until the flyers felt aligned with his voice and the professionalism of his brand.


#### Outcome

The final flyers became versatile business development tools:

Wes now uses them in client pitches to clearly explain his process.

They serve as effective leave-behinds, reinforcing conversations and helping potential clients recall the value of Putnam Recruiting.

The design struck a balance between polished professionalism and approachable clarity, reflecting the personalized service Wes provides.

### Key Takeaway

This project demonstrates how thoughtful design can transform a recruiting firm’s story into a tangible, client-friendly narrative. By pairing clear messaging with clean visuals, the flyers not only support Putnam Recruiting’s BD efforts but also strengthen the brand’s position as a trusted partner in talent acquisition.
