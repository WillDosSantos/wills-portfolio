### Summary

The decision to create an NFT was driven by curiosity and a lack of knowledge about how NFTs work. The journey began with joining a Telegram group called NFT Growth Squad and expressing interest in starting a project. The collaboration with an enthusiastic individual, despite not knowing them personally, led to the creation of artwork centered around a rebellious theme. The initial 150 pieces were handcrafted, which was different from typical NFT projects that use automated processes. The lack of understanding about NFT traits and building a reputable brand was realized after the project's completion. Despite these challenges, the artwork generated excitement and sold out quickly, likely due to its quality, limited quantity, and affordable price. Lessons learned include the need for a well-planned NFT project beyond just a visually appealing image. The small but devoted community surrounding the project is encouraging, and the plan is to continue developing and expanding Punk Rock Robots, potentially through the introduction of a game.

#### The Idea
The decision to venture into the world of NFTs was not an easy one for me. I must admit that my knowledge of NFTs was quite limited when I first embarked on this journey. However, I was determined to explore this emerging field and understand its dynamics.

In my quest for knowledge, I stumbled upon a Telegram group called the NFT Growth Squad. Intrigued by the potential of NFTs on the Avalanche platform, I decided to join the group and immerse myself in the discussions. It was here that I connected with individuals who shared my enthusiasm for this new technology.

One person, in particular, caught my attention. They were genuinely impressed by my previous work and expressed a keen interest in collaborating with me. Although I was initially skeptical about working with a stranger, I decided to take a chance and explore the possibilities.

#### First Challenge
The first challenge presented to me was to create a unique PFP (picture for proof) concept. I took some time to ponder over this task, and it was during this reflection that a profound realization struck me. I became acutely aware of the oppressive nature of conformity and how it stifles individuality. This revelation inspired me to create artwork that symbolized resistance against this assimilation.

Interestingly, I chose to handcraft the first 150 pieces of artwork, which diverged from the usual approach taken by most NFT projects. Unbeknownst to me at the time, there were scripts and tools available that could generate images quickly. This lack of knowledge regarding the technical aspects of NFT creation became evident to me later on.

Despite my inexperience, people were genuinely captivated by the artwork. The person I collaborated with handled the marketing for the project, although their approach seemed more focused on short-term gains rather than building a reputable NFT brand.

Unfortunately, I discovered that this person was involved in multiple projects simultaneously, which led to a less-than-ideal outcome for me. Moreover, they claimed 50% of the commission and earnings from the NFT line, leaving me with a feeling of being taken advantage of.

However, credit must be given where it is due. The marketing efforts, though flawed, contributed to the sell-out of our NFTs within an hour. I believe the success can be attributed to the reasonable pricing, the quality of the artwork, and the limited supply of only 150 pieces.

This experience has taught me valuable lessons. It has become evident that a well-thought-out plan is crucial for any NFT project. Mere visual appeal is not enough; there needs to be a sense of purpose and utility behind the creation. Although our community is still relatively small, the dedication of a few members is encouraging.

Moving forward, I am committed to the growth and development of Punk Rock Robots. It is my intention to evolve this project into something even more meaningful and impactful. With this in mind, I have decided to prioritize utility, and I am currently exploring the possibility of creating a game associated with the NFT line.

In conclusion, my journey into the world of NFTs has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs. Despite the challenges and setbacks, I remain determined to navigate this exciting landscape and contribute to its growth and evolution. Stay tuned for the next chapter in the Punk Rock Robots saga.
