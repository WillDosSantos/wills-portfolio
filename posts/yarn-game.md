### The Story Behind Yarn

After a can of toxic waste is dumped into a river, fish used to make cat food turns normally cute and cuddly cats into menacing decaying creatures—Cat Zombies! Now they are terrorizing the city and it's up to our hero, Doodle, a brave little ball of yarn, to save the day.

Yarn is a beautiful indie 2D atmospheric platformer with a cute little character superhero. Jump through this diverse, gorgeous galaxy world and explore Meow Town or the Scratchy Dungeons, but watch out for the monster zombie cats! This quirky jumper is a fury of fun!

### Gameplay

Each level is being terrorized by a Cat Zombie that you have to knock out, along with a number of obstacles that you have to help Doodle avoid. Jump over spikes and saws, and pivot off the walls in order to scale up them. Collect all the stars and destroy the Cat Zombie as fast as you can. Best of luck, and remember—keep on the lookout for Cat Zombies!

### Design & Development

The game went through several iterations before finding its final form. The initial concept explored different gameplay mechanics, but we eventually settled on a physics-based jumping system inspired by games like King of Thieves. This approach created a more dynamic and entertaining experience that players found addictive and engaging.

The game features hand-drawn 2D artwork with a charming, atmospheric style. Each world has its own unique visual identity, from the colorful Meow Town to the dark and mysterious Scratchy Dungeons. The character design of Doodle—a simple but expressive ball of yarn—became instantly recognizable and beloved by players.
