### Overview

Lembra is a memorial platform I’ve been building to help families and friends create lasting digital spaces for their loved ones. The purpose behind it is simple but meaningful: to provide a place where memories, stories, photos, and tributes can live on and be shared, without being lost to scattered social media posts or forgotten files.

My goal with Lembra is to make it easy, respectful, and personal — a place that feels more like a tribute than just another profile online. It’s designed for anyone who wants to preserve and celebrate a life in a thoughtful way, while also giving families tools to manage and moderate the space.

I’m aiming to launch Lembra in the next two months, and I’m excited to see it grow into a resource that helps people remember and honor those who have passed.

#### Challenge

Lembra began as something deeply personal. Earlier this year, after my dad passed away, I wanted to create a space that honored him in a way that felt more meaningful than a fleeting social media post. I wanted something permanent, thoughtful, and worthy of his memory.

That became the seed of Lembra — a memorial platform where families and friends can gather stories, photos, and tributes in one place, creating a lasting digital legacy.

Designing Lembra hasn’t been without its challenges. It’s not just another app — it’s something that has to balance sensitivity with usability. Every design choice needed to feel respectful, timeless, and easy to use for people in moments of grief. Striking that balance between technology and humanity has been one of the hardest — but also most rewarding — parts of the process.

I’m working to launch Lembra in the next two months, and my hope is that it can help others, the way I needed it to help me — as a place to remember, honor, and celebrate the lives of the people we love.
