### Summary
Jeff and team wanted a career that would showcase the worklife of Planning Center and appeal to folks in the industry. I spent time with a shot list for this and storyboarded out the ideas before running around the office doing interviews and putting a camera in peoples face. Thanks everyone for your patience with the process.
