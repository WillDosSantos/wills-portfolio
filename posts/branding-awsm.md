### Overview

When I set out to design the Awesome (AWSM) brand, my goal was to create an identity that felt bold, modern, and versatile — a brand that could scale across digital products, print, and culture while still feeling approachable and inspiring.

#### Challenge

Awesome needed more than just a logo; it needed a visual language that could stand out in competitive markets while being flexible enough for future growth. The challenge was to strike the right balance between:

Simplicity – clean enough to be instantly recognizable.

Energy – conveying the excitement and dynamism behind the brand name.

Versatility – adaptable across social, app icons, print, and merch.

#### Process

1. Exploration & Ideation

I began by sketching broad concepts around the core idea of “make it awesome.” Early explorations included wordmarks, geometric marks, and abstract symbols. I tested ideas with different weights, alignments, and typographic personalities.

2. Logo Development

Through iterations, I refined the logomark into a radiating starburst / asterisk symbol — a bold form that conveys excitement, amplification, and possibility. Paired with a strong wordmark, it created a flexible lockup system.

- Explored variations of “AWSM” in all caps, lowercase, and stylized fonts.

- Tested minimalist vs. expressive versions to see which resonated with the brand values.

- Balanced the geometric precision of the mark with human-centered typography.

3. Color & Typography

To push the energy of the brand, I selected a vibrant pink-to-orange gradient as a primary color treatment. It reflects momentum and creativity.
Typography leaned toward modern sans-serifs, providing legibility and impact while pairing well with the energetic logo.

4. Visual Extensions

- Beyond the logo, I expanded the brand system with:

- Tagline lockups: “MAKE IT AWESOME” in bold stacked forms.

- Pattern systems: radiating star motifs as backgrounds.

- Dynamic applications: gradient overlays, cut-out photography inside the logomark, and vibrant product mockups.

#### Outcome

The final brand identity established Awesome as bold, energetic, and scalable. The design system:

- Works seamlessly across digital, social, and product applications.

- Creates instant recognition through the iconic starburst/asterisk mark.

- Reinforces the message of energy, momentum, and making it awesome.

- The result is a brand that doesn’t just look good — it communicates a mindset.
