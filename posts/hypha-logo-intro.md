## Hypha Motion Logo Intro

A collaborative motion graphics project with Jake Wilson from Sleightworks, where I served as Lead Designer and Director. This project involved creating a dynamic logo introduction sequence for Hypha, showcasing the brand's innovative approach to decentralized technology.

### Project Overview

Working alongside Jake Wilson, I led the design direction and creative vision for Hypha's motion logo intro. The project required translating Hypha's brand identity into compelling motion graphics that would capture attention and communicate the company's forward-thinking approach to blockchain technology. I also wanted to experiment with AI on this project to see how easy it would be to use prompts to create a great logo animation.

### My Role

- **Lead Designer**: Conceptualized and designed the overall visual direction
- **Director**: Guided the creative process and ensured brand consistency
- **Motion Graphics**: Developed key animation sequences and transitions

### Final Deliverables

The project resulted in a comprehensive set of motion graphics assets that effectively communicate Hypha's brand identity through dynamic, engaging animations.
