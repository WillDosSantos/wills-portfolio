### The Why

Halloween is borning. Every single house has rotting corpses, demons, jack-o-lanterns. It's predictable now. When I was a kid, I loved going to Universal Studios and Disneyland and seeing the amazing special effects and experiences they would create for their audiences. I wanted to create the same experience at my home and what better night than halloween. I loved every minute of creating this. I got to involve my kids. I heard from real people as I watched their faces light up with joy when they heard the orchestral music from around the corner of our street. Many of them thanked me and my family for creating something special for their night.

### UX design for real life

I usually create my design work via the computer. Everything is digital. But this was something that I really enjoyed creating for real life. Seeing peoples reactions to the final product created a lasting memory for them, my family, and myself.
