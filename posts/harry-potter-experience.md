### The Why

Halloween is borning. Every single house has rotting corpses, demons, jack-o-lanterns. It's predictable now. When I was a kid, I loved going to Universal Studios and Disneyland and seeing the amazing special effects and experiences they would create for their audiences. I wanted to create the same experience at my home and what better night than halloween. I loved every minute of creating this. I got to involve my kids. I heard from real people as I watched their faces light up with joy when they heard the orchestral music from around the corner of our street. Many of them thanked me and my family for creating something special for their night.

### Spider (Aragog)

We made Aragog with expanding foam, pvc pipes, hair wigs, and a lot of spray paint. Ironically, I don't really like spiders. But this guy was fun to work on and he has become a staple for our Halloween decor.

### Experience Goals

- **Immersive Guidance**: Provide clear navigation through exhibits while preserving a sense of discovery and surprise
- **Narrative Alignment**: Sync digital interactions with the canon timeline to keep fans anchored in the story
- **Accessibility & Flow**: Ensure the experience was friendly for families, first-time visitors, and seasoned Potterheads alike
- **Modular Content**: Build a system that could scale for new scenes, characters, and seasonal events

### Interaction Design

The core interaction model revolved around context-aware panels that adapt as the visitor moves through the exhibit. Each screen delivers just-in-time information so guests can stay focused on what is happening in front of them. We had a floating Wanted Wizard sign for those people that wanted to snap a quick pic and tag us online.


### Motion & Sound

To keep the UI feeling alive and magical, I combined subtle parallax motion with layered music pulled straight from the films. Every interaction has a corresponding sound signature so users know when they have activated the right action.


### Outcome

The final experience blends tactile storytelling with responsive digital layers. Guests receive a guided journey that feels cinematic, personal, and shareable. The modular system keeps the experience fresh and easy to extend, while the UI remains intuitive for audiences of all ages.
