### My Planning Center

This was an effort to interview some customers and build a marketing campaign around them. Ultimately, we decided against going with it but was great to work on the branding for this and meet the people that used our products.

### GoGoPool Logo Intro

As with any marketing, logo intros and outros for marketing and content videos are a must when building your brand.

### First Step Keynote

I created this concept of taking the first step in our industry with GoGoPool. Steve had a vision to build an interactive keynote around our community. This was the custom logo intro I did for it. Ultimately, we went with something stock. Fun to work on though.
