Mystery, wealth, and secret places? Sign me up! I really enjoyed working on this project with my mentor, Johnny Gault, and the rest of the team at GoGoPool. This was Johnny's passion project and his idea for this was to treat it like a speak easy. When he said that, my mind went back to that beautiful art deco design of the 1920s. It was that mixed with some greek mythology. The greek goddess Pandaisia, was the goddess of rich banquets and she also "shared the wealth." This was the mindset behind creating Pandasia; yes, I know it's spelled incorrectly. No reason to it other than it looked cooler that way. 

### Sketches

The branding was a big part of this project and it was really good to start working on something aside from validation and staking for GoGoPool. It was also a different style to try out so I was excited about that prospect and what I could come up with.

This project took the team roughly 4 weeks to build which meant design had to be done in less than half that time. There was a ton of wireframes for the ux and comps for the ui. Not to mention I wanted to do something really cool with Lottie Animations on the welcome page which you can check out here. [pandasia.io](https://pandasia.io)
