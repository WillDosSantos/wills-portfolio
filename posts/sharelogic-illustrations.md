### Sharelogic, in color

I've been working on a small set of illustrations for Sharelogic. The goal was simple: weave the brand colors directly into the shapes so the pieces feel unmistakably Sharelogicâ€”clean geometry, crisp edges, and a bright palette that reads instantly on product and marketing surfaces.

Here are a few of the studies:

  <img src="/images/posts/sharelogic-illustrations/laptop.png" alt="Laptop" />
  <img src="/images/posts/sharelogic-illustrations/hex.png" alt="Hex" />
  
</div>
