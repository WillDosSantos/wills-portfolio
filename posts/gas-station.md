### Overview

Hypha’s Depot is the hub where users contribute towards Layer 1 gas fees and track their rewards. While the product was powerful, the previous design had usability challenges — crowded layouts, unclear hierarchy, and too much technical information competing for attention. My goal as Lead Designer was to create a cleaner, more intuitive interface that improves clarity, user trust, and engagement.

#### Challenge

The old Depot design made it difficult for users to quickly understand:

- How much they had contributed.

- What their rewards were.

- Where to take action.

Information was technically correct, but the presentation lacked structure. Users needed a clearer information hierarchy, simpler navigation, and a more modern, trustworthy aesthetic.

#### Exploration & Ideation

I began by sketching broad concepts around the core idea of “make it awesome.” Early explorations included wordmarks, geometric marks, and abstract symbols. I tested ideas with different weights, alignments, and typographic personalities.


#### Logo Development

Through iterations, I refined the logomark into a radiating starburst / asterisk symbol — a bold form that conveys excitement, amplification, and possibility. Paired with a strong wordmark, it created a flexible lockup system.

1. Restructuring the Layout

I introduced a two-tier hierarchy:

- Dashboard Metrics (at a glance) → Total Contributions, Active Pumps, Hypha Points, Gas Levels, and Uptime. These give users immediate feedback without digging into tables.

- Detailed Data (below) → Fuel Stations list and Contract Parameters, accessible when users want specifics.

- This shift ensured new and experienced users both get value right away.

2. Simplifying Navigation

The left sidebar consolidates actions into clear categories:

- Fuel Pumps

- How it Works

- My Contributions

- Recent Activity

This improves discoverability and reduces cognitive load.

3. Cleaner Visual Language

- Adopted a fresh green gradient in the hero section to reinforce growth and energy.

- Designed card-style components with consistent spacing and typography for scannability.

- Used icons and labels to make technical data more approachable.

4. Improving Trust & Transparency

Blockchain users care deeply about trust. I emphasized transparency by:

- Displaying contract parameters in a clean, legible table.

- Highlighting transaction history in the Fuel Stations list with sortable/searchable data.

### Outcome

The redesign resulted in a cleaner, more user-friendly Depot that:

- Makes contribution status and rewards immediately clear.

- Reduces friction in navigation, guiding users smoothly through tasks.

- Balances technical transparency with approachable design, strengthening user trust.

- Sets a scalable design pattern for future Hypha products.

### Key Takeaway

The new Depot design shows how thoughtful UI/UX can transform complex blockchain tools into approachable, engaging experiences. By focusing on hierarchy, clarity, and trust, I created a design system that not only looks cleaner but also improves how users interact with Hypha.
