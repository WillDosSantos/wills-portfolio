The initial design for [gogopool.com](https://gogopool.com) was very playful; too playful. And that starts to come back you in terms of feedback from people that have millions of dollars staked on your protocol. They think that it's too kiddy, that you're an NFT project, etc. We decided to try another approach. These are some of the comps I did at first before landing on the design that exists today.
