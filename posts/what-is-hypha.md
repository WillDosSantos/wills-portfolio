### Overview

Hypha’s mission is to make Layer 1 blockchains permissionless and accessible. The landing page needed to not only explain a highly technical product but also build trust, inspire adoption, and visually capture the momentum of growth in the blockchain ecosystem.

My role as Lead & Founding Designer was to translate this complex story into a landing page that clearly communicates value, differentiates Hypha, and guides users toward action.

#### Challenge

Blockchain infrastructure is inherently technical and can be difficult for newcomers to understand. The landing page had to:

- Explain Hypha’s purpose in plain language.

- Show credibility by aligning with recognizable global brands.

- Demonstrate token utility and its role in the ecosystem.

- Convert visitors into engaged users, whether by reading the whitepaper, registering a node, or contacting sales.

#### Process

1. Information Hierarchy

I structured the page with a clear storytelling flow:

- Hero Section – Bold headline (“Layer 1 growth and increasing adoption”) and visual 3D assets set the stage for innovation and growth. Clear CTAs (“Read Whitepaper” / “Contact Sales”) drive action.

- Feature Highlights – A row of benefit cards explains Hypha’s key advantages: supporting Avalanche L1 Season, earning more with Minipools, faster onboarding, and an all-inclusive experience.

- Social Proof – Logos from major tech companies (Spotify, Microsoft, Netflix, etc.) build trust and show ecosystem relevance.

- How It Works – A step-by-step breakdown simplifies complex token mechanics into four easy-to-digest points.

- Ecosystem Growth – Additional visuals reinforce how Hypha ties everything together and scales with user participation.

2. Visual Language

- 3D gradients & futuristic shapes → communicate innovation and scalability.

- Clean typography & white space → balance technical credibility with approachability.

- Iconography → used to translate blockchain concepts (staking, onboarding, licensing) into instantly understandable visuals.

3. Guiding Actions

Every section pushes toward deeper engagement: from curiosity (hero headline) → trust (social proof) → understanding (how it works) → conversion (CTAs).

#### Outcome

The final brand identity established Awesome as bold, energetic, and scalable. The design system:

- Works seamlessly across digital, social, and product applications.

- Creates instant recognition through the iconic starburst/asterisk mark.

- Reinforces the message of energy, momentum, and making it awesome.

- The result is a brand that doesn’t just look good — it communicates a mindset.
