### Summary

It's been 11 years, and what a journey it has been. Now it's time for the next one. I've gained a wide variety of new skills and sharpened old ones. For some time now, I've had the desire to lead a team and have gotten some experience in that arena with certain groups at Planning Center. But 11 years is a long time, and I want to see what else is out there and what else I can accomplish.

#### The Goal
I remember when I was a kid I went Antitrust the movie. The story was about a young software programmer given the opportunity of a life time by the CEO of a tech company who, as it turned out, had some sinister intentions. But, the thing that stuck out to me even as a kid, was how cool the working environment of the offices of Nurve were. I remember thinking, "One day, I'll work at a place like that." It was a goal that eventually faded in high school, but then came back around again in my early years at college.

#### Planning Center

I saw the post in 2011 for Front End Designer at Planning Center. I wasn't sure about the details of the job as there was a fair amount that I had never done before. But I decided to give it a go. I'm not going to lie, when I got a reply back from Jeff, the CEO, I was a bit surprised. I was extremely motivated but scared. I knew I could do the design work no problem. I was pretty confident in my HTML and CSS but my JS....that was lacking.

At first, I ignored his email. Yup, just straight up ignored it. I thought there was no way I would be able to do that job and why even waste his or my time. Then, he followed up asking if I still planned on applying. That email changed my life. I decided to give it a whirl. I gave him a bullshit excuse "oh sorry didn't see the first email. Must have went to spam." I stayed up all night working on the task and sent it off at around 3:00am. I remember turning to my girlfriend, now wife, saying "Welp, there's no chance I'll get that gig."

The next day, I got a reply back. I was shocked. Jeff asked if I could come down for a visit to their offices in Carlsbad and meet with the lead designer. After my nerves settled, I replied back with an affirmative yes.

I left early the follow Friday morning at 5:00am and made the drive down to Carlsbad from the high desert. Jeff answered the door and gave me a tour of the office. He was a super nice guy and the office space was unbelievable. It was even better than what I saw in the movie years ago. The interview was one of the longest, most fun, and strangest interviews I've ever done. I was probably the biggest contributor to the strange part.

When it was over, I felt as if I already had the job. But, it wasn't for sure. And I thought there was always a chance I wouldn't get it. Then, two days later, Jeff called me telling me I got the job. I was completely over the moon.

Little did I know, how much Jeff Berg would have an impact in my life. Because of him, and all the folks at Planning Center, I have experienced such wonderful and amazing things. Things that most people will never get the chance to experience. I worked my butt off there, and I know Jeff and the company recognized that. It was truly unforgetable. 

Now, 11 years later to the date that I joined, it's time for me to try something else. With the skills and knowledge that I gained at Planning Center, I feel like it's time for me to share that with other fast upcoming startups. Sharing my knowledge and experience, seeing people grow, and learning new things has become such a passion of mine; I owe so much to that wonderful place. 

I will never forget, the man that opened the door for me that day. The chance he gave to some kid from the high desert. It really has been such a priviledge to work there. Here's to you all. May your journey in life be filled with the same joy I have been able to experience thus far. 

Thank you Planning Center and thank you, Jeff Berg.

Will-
