### Summary

It's been 11 years, and what a journey it has been. Now it's time for the next one. I've gained a wide variety of new skills and sharpened old ones. For some time now, I've had the desire to lead a team and have gotten some experience in that arena with certain groups at Planning Center. But 11 years is a long time, and I want to see what else is out there and what else I can accomplish.

#### The Dream
When I was a kid my parents took me to see this movie, "Antitrust". I have no idea why we picked to see that as a family but we did. I didn't really know what to expect but knew it was about computers. The story is centered around this young guy named Milo. He's a top shot programmer working with his buddies in a startup they call "SkullBox" - probably getting the spelling wrong here but you get the idea.

They are on the verge of getting some good ol' VC funding when Milo is offered a job by mega-corp. Nurve CEO Gary Winston, who plays a sort of Bill Gates mixed with Steve Jobs kind of character.

Milo accepts, and his world is changed seemingly overnight. He's flown out to the corporate office in Portland, gets setup at an awesome looking office (picture Google before it was Google) and is taken under the wing of the CEO. Pretty awesome, right?

Well, unfortunately for Milo, it doesn't go well with Milo at Nurve. I mean he does well in the end, but it's not without the loss of a friend who is killed by the villianous Gary Winston.
