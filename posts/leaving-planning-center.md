### Summary

It's been 11 years, and what a journey it has been. Now it's time for the next one. I've gained a wide variety of new skills and sharpened old ones. For some time now, I've had the desire to lead a team and have gotten some experience in that arena with certain groups at Planning Center. But 11 years is a long time, and I want to see what else is out there and what else I can accomplish.

#### The Dream
When I was a kid my parents took me to see this movie, "Antitrust". I have no idea why we picked to see that as a family but we did. I didn't really know what to expect but knew it was about computers. The story is centered around this young guy named Milo. He's a top shot programmer working with his buddies in a startup they call "SkullBox" - probably getting the spelling wrong here but you get the idea.

They are on the verge of getting some good ol' VC funding when Milo is offered a job by mega-corp. Nurve CEO Gary Winston, who plays a sort of Bill Gates mixed with Steve Jobs kind of character.

Milo accepts, and his world is changed seemingly overnight. He's flown out to the corporate office in Portland, gets setup at an awesome looking office (picture Google before it was Google) and is taken under the wing of the CEO. Pretty awesome, right?

Eventually, Milo finds out that there is something more sinister afoot and the movie takes some twists and turns. But the thing that caught my attention was that first act. The badass office. I remember thinking to myself, "Wow, I want to work at a place as cool as that." I started to have this vision in the back of my mind of what that reality could look like. I didn't know that almost a decade later, it would become a reality for me. 

#### The Reality

I saw the post in 2011 for Front End Designer at Planning Center. I wasn't sure about the details of the job as there was a fair amount that I had never done before. But I decided to give it a go. I'm not going to lie, when I got a reply back from Jeff, the CEO, I was a bit surprised. I was extremely motivated but scared. I knew I could do the design work no problem. I was pretty confident in my HTML and CSS but my JS....that was lacking.

So, I didn't respond back. I just assumed I wasn't good enough. But good ol' Jeff, he followed up with me a day or two later asking if I was going to turn in his code challenge. I thought about it and decided to give it a go. I responded back with some bs about how the email went into my spam folder. Not my proudest moment but I own it and I'm thankful he did reach back out.

I completed the code challege in a couple hours and sent it off. I thought that there was no way that they would look at the code challenge and approve me for a follow up. Sure enough, they did.

Jeff followed up with me the next day asking if I wanted to come in for an in-person interview that Friday. I couldn't believe it. I took the two and half hour drive down to San Diego from the high desert leaving at 5 a.m. I arrived to a very unassuming office center. The exteriors were all the same and there wasn't a company name on the building for the address I was given. I walked up, rang the bell, and Jeff answered.

"Hey, I'm Jeff! Come on in!" he greeted me with a smile and warm handshake. He showed me around the building and gave me a tour. The interior design was amazing and I couldn't believe it.
