### Summary
When I joined ReadyFive, I was given a background on the idea of the application by James Miller (CEO & Founder) and Tanner Mares (Former CTO and Co. Founder). As Founding Designer of the application, I needed to find a way to make the app simple to use in addition to give it a clean and appealing visual look.

There was some context provided initially about the name. Ready Five is a military term used on aircraft carriers for immediate response. If you look at the runway of an aircraft carrier, it forms a sort of upsidedown y. So I decided to integrate that into the design. I also included an idea of a mobile phone traveling fast, to emphasized the speed of notification, the innovation behind the mobile technology, and showcase the "r" and "f" somehow in the design.
