Sorry about the lack of imagery and missing styles. After switching over to Netlify, I discovered some errors with my old site. Namely, the fact that I hadn't updating Gatsby and had a long list of outdated packages. New sites and a fixed site is in the works.

Thank you for your patience and interest in my site.
